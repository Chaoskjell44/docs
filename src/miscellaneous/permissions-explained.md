# All Bot Permissions explained
***
For the Bot to work fully it needs many permissions.

Either you manually give it each needed permissions or you give it the `Administrator` permission which will just make it "work".

Below is a rough explanation of what each permission is used for:


* `read_messages` "Allows the bot to view the content of a channel."

* `manage_channels` "Allows the bot to create, rename, recategorize, and delete channels."

* `manage_roles` "Allows the bot to create and edit roles, give and take away roles from users, and adjust a channel's role permissions."

* `manage_webhooks` "Allows the bot to create webhooks for transcripts, and for staff to use the dashboard to send messages or tags in open tickets."

* `send_messages` "Allows the bot to send messages in channels."

* `send_messages_in_threads` "Allows the bot to send messages in threads."

* `create_public_threads` "Allows the bot to create public threads."

* `create_private_threads` "Allows the bot to create private threads, such as thread mode tickets and the /notes command for channel tickets."

* `embed_links` "Allows the bot to send ticket panels, welcome messages, and tags that include an embedded message."

* `attach_files` "Allows the bot to assign the attach files permission to the ticket opener."

* `add_reactions` "Allows the bot to add the buttons to ticket panels, welcome messages, and all commands that use buttons."

* `use_external_emojis` "Allows the bot to use non-server emojis in ticket panels, welcome messages, and tags. Bot must still be in the other server to use them."

* `mention_everyone` "Allows the bot to mention everyone, here and all roles in a ticket."

* `manage_threads` "Allows the bot to create, rename, close, and delete threads."

* `read_message_history` "Allows the bot to read all messages in a channel."

* `use_application_commands` "Allows the bot's slash commands to work."

These permissions are mandatory so that the Bot can work. Any other permission can be denied for the bot to use since those aren't used by the bot. 

> **Note:** The used Permissions can change when the bot gets a new update or feature.
