# Configuring the Bot: Permissions
***

You can configure the Bot's permissions in two ways.

If you give the bot **Administrator** permissions it will just "work" and won't need much permission configuration.
If you don't want to give the Bot Administrator access to your server then you will need to do a bunch of Permission configurations.

This section will guide you through configuring the Bot's Permissions when using **Administrator** and without using **Administrator** permissions.
